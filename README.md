# Cont-vs-Disc
University Social Service Project

This project involved conducting a calculus survey to examine how mathematics students distinguish between basic sequences and continuous functions. My responsibilities included:

- Collaborated on the design and documentation of a calculus survey for Mathematics students.
- Applied the survey using a convenience sampling method (applied to all students present on a given day).
- Performed ETL processes on the collected data and derived insights using Excel and Jupyter Notebooks with Python ( using Pandas and Matplotlib).
- Presented conclusions and proposed solutions in a formal report, including results, recommendations, and references.
- Successfully completed my University Social Service requirement.
